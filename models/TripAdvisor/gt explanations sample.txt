the lounge area is lovely and the desserts there are amazing
super location on top of pacific place
staff are very friendly though especially raj at the president 's club desk and the
we enjoyed the room and the hotel immensely
i was also <unk> by the high price of using wifi
large midtown hotel the hyatt is just steps from grand central terminal and convenient to
fast wifi ( free to 1g daily ) access to public transport
i expect more from an <unk> real downfall for this hotel is its restaurants
good value 140 exec room inc
although the views from the roof top bar restaurant were very good after dark
the accommodation is basic even though highly priced
also the hotel is set back from the street so even the outside rooms may
nice n helping staff and good breakfast spread on 18th floor
there 's nothing terrible about this place - but there are way too many better
but food is decently priced and great
i paid cash for the bus back to the airport not realising that a limo
the limited time we spent in the lounge was great and the service exceptional
spend a quick 2 days at this hotel and found it to be friendly staff
the service was good
i actually had some very nice pasta with a pesto sauce along with some draft
beach is beautiful with ample chairs
unpretentious hotel in a fantastic location
excellent service
we ate dinner one night in the hotel as it was raining very heavy
the toilet bowl had an unpleasant smell for the few days that we stayed
but the room was great
everyone from the cleaners to the go 's to the manager are very friendly and
the small pool area is adjacent sharing the terrific view
everything was very high standard and the buffet breakfast was fantastic
it might well be the fact that paris hotels are different but we did not
the rooms are quite small but really showing their age
any worries for later about noise did not occur as we had a great nights
good shopping and eating too are close at hand ( the pizza and hot chocolate
generally the best service is in south east asia
the same high price applied to all other items of clothing
excellent hotel , i will return !
but the selection close to the pool was fine - with the benefit of chiller
i went to the front desk
you will find their aluminum floored pool which ranges from <unk> to 5 feet in
for a budget hotel you could do much worse and if you are after a
highly recommend this amazing hotel
the reason i am hung up on grout is that last week i reviewed the
your average centrally located business hotel
bathroom was huge with a big tub and separate shower <unk> in all a great
most of my meetings were in the financial district in the <unk> area and the
i look forward to coming and staying again
it would of been expensive to eat meals here otherwise
yet intimate and like all high floors has a nice view of tokyo city
the walk was easy and so picturesque
the hotel staff are nice and attentative
in room dining served cold tea with breakfast - a remarkable service error given what
affordable parking
hilton deansgate is about 15 min walk from the city center main shopping area
good food choices for breakfast
front desk and concierge very polite
so we called and luckily got a room in this elegant and luxurious hotel
was in a good location for melbourne
not black tea )
good location but expensive
i ordered room service and the chicken soup was the worst i have ever had
to compensate that the beds are very comfortable with pretty good tv channels selection
nice <unk> between <unk> and <unk> area
swimming pool is nice but opening hours can be extended a little bit
perfect for early am flights
the hotel is fine - but a bit tired - could do with being modernised
house guests are provided with a free <unk> transport card for unlimited travel bus train
easy walk to anywhere
) i was a little disappointed and astonished by the person handling the taxis out
and proximity to the lifts made everything very convenient - went from parking to their
the lobby is very nice and i love the modern fireplace
it is a short walk to the funicular which will take you to the foot
high floor will give you the best views
we got a good nights sleep each night due to a comfortable bed and pillows
i stayed there one night as i had to take shinkansen next day
best hotel at mex airport
- tv reception was <unk> due to the ridiculously hard beds
the breakfast had a few different choices and was very good
the tables at the reception were peeling and needed urgent <unk> .
with probably the best shower of my trip
a room on the 2nd floor was opened for breakfast
decor of the main areas was decent
pool and common areas are lovely
hotel does offer free shuttle service to dubai mall
and that the floor in the shower is a little too smooth for my liking
the front desk staff responded immediately and within a few minutes they had someone on
room service vs <unk> shop closes at 3
being on the 2 floor i really felt in the middle of the party so
the lobby decor is interesting and many was snapping shots of the silver ball right
great airport hotel near in-n-out
clean and spacious
pool area is very nice
good independent air con and a good sized bathroom with a shower over a bath
anyway the rest of the stay was very good
the apartment very clean
the rooms were a nice size and the room included a large walk-in shower
the building is gorgeous and the room service food quite good
is it really too much to expect a major brand airport hotel
guam was interesting to visit for about a week
the internet access is only through cable ( it means no internet for cell phones
my fourth stay at this property over a 9 month period
