the pide that came out in about 10 minutes ( others are faster ) was
one bite had me dreaming of eggs on sunday morning
efficient airport with slot machines everywhere
it was my favourite but theres also a chocolate peanut butter one which was delicious
we will be back !
our server bartender was great and the sushi was delicious and fresh
i would really recommend to to see this show to everyone it is unique and
- club sandwich on asiago bread
the grilled bread was great to soak up everything
the rice pilaf perfect
the biscuits are smothered in strawberries and blackberries
alcoholic beverages cost extra .
the garlic stir fried beef tenderloin was also the highlight of the meal as it
the bagel was dry and undercooked the spread was tasteless and the prices went bad
i was reading some of the reviews of my fellow yelpers and i was surprised
tremendous is one of my favourite late night go-to spots in mississauga
owners awesome & staff is fantastic
the dipping sauce was excellent
i absolutely loved the flavor and texture of the cake as well as the chocolate
there was mixed toppings in everything
massive portions of delicious meat <unk> off of skewers served by oily <unk> that most
the turkey burger is better than average
) it 's the perfect mix of salty
sweet and sour pork was crunchy
the white beans kind of overpowered the meat flavors
great quick 4th of july meal without all the mess in your own kitchen
i will be back to have lunch soon !
had dinner at pio pio a few weeks ago after reading rave reviews on yelp
everything with the shortribs was great for sure will be back for that grilled cheese
a nice treat when someone else is paying because i 'm much too conservative
sticky floors
took over a half an hour to have food that was called 2 days ahead
i replace the sour cream with guacamole
came here on a tuesday after usually going to the uptown one although i hate
small portions and terrible presentation
made my morning with a nice cup of black coffee
and the place is super cute inside
takes me back !
best 13th floor experience in years
it 's got all the toppings you can think of and it 's in a
i 've come in to see joe regarding my media controls on the steering wheel
lots of topping options and made to order
try something different
i only go there if i 'm really in a last minute bind .
i 'll even eat the canned corned beef hash on occasion when i need the
and smaller atmosphere makes harkins an easy selection over the <unk> elsewhere
they have pretty much anything you would need for home remodel or small projects you
great seats one row behind the legend 's bench
this place makes really great smoothies
only stopped inside because mexican place had closed down already next door
perhaps most disappointing was that my husband ordered a steak with a baked sweet potato
but this is located near the plaza with plenty of outdoor seating near the big
it 's a hot dog so i was n't expecting an orgasmic culinary experience
stopped in for lunch while on vacation
the dumplings were good but reminded me too much of the frozen kind that you
it was nearly closing time so it was basically just us dining in on late
my husband liked the <unk> sauce which was oily and <unk> and also good
pull into the parking lot using one of the side roads off superior for a
the rice was ok but was kinda bland
it can be hard to find a table if you come during the lunch rush
the food came out quickly and was piping hot
here is the order of greatness - dessert
this shack goes through its <unk> of being good and average but to be honest
i stopped in here with a young lady for a late lunch
highlight is the roasted chicken
however this dessert required no cooking or preparation on their behalf aside from <unk> <unk>
food options were pretty standard but both our dishes tasted really good
the food was awesome ( crepe with speck and cabbage ) the drinks were awesome
i do n't think i 'll be coming back - you can find better food
it 's tough and tasteless ) crawfish available
the atmosphere is very welcoming and i love the open rooftop bar
we mostly are off of the happy hour menu
the atmosphere is clean and inviting
the server adam is as amazing as everyone says
we were not a huge fan of the mousse cake
the food itself was overall very tasty
and they rush you through the line !
i will be back again to try more of their endless variety of tapas to
we really enjoy the happy hour here
the crust was biscuit crispy and almost flaky like a pie but not quite
chicken pakoras were okay but fish pakoras were light and flaky with a wonderful crispiness
just another subpar korean restaurant that tries but fails to offer standard korean food
we had the chicken satay
however i would have to order something different
good sales and non sale prices
the initial host we talked to to get a table for our party of seven
i myself am a health nut so i <unk> ask if their food is organic
my husband and i both choose the wonderful spaetzle with brown gravy and delicious sweet
their lunch and breakfast food is also great
the options on the dim sum carts were limited
1500 reviews on google in south chandler fake
super nice staff and great ice cream
fried rice noodles with beef
at good prices
but the staff is friendly and the food is fresh
the curry had a excellent flavor and wasnt watered down like other red curry 's
but this is poor customer service
we had a terrible experience a few days prior at prestige , which made me
shower and swimming in smoke in your short trip from the elevator to the exit
1 ) my iced tea literally took 15 minutes to receive and i had to
